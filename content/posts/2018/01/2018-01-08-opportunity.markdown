A couple of months ago I got the opportunity to be a Lead iOS Developer at [Gogo Business Aviation][gba]. Accepting the job offer would mean moving to Colorado. Big leaps like that don't come with safety nets. You have to commit. Some people were startled at the amount of uncertainty involved with large life changes like this.

The thing is: with the exception of its having an end, life is always uncertain. You just have to accept it. Hop on when you get an opportunity. Don't let that train leave you on your heels wondering "What if?"
