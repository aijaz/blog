Every so often a Muslim friends contacts me saying they're coming to visit Denver and would like to know which Halal restaurants they can visit. I decide to post the list of restaurants here, so I can share it easily and update it periodically.

1. [Pita Fresh][pitafresh] - We use them a lot for catering. Their shawarma sandwiches are delicious and their quality is consistently good. For catering they cut their shawarmas into small bits, so it's easy to sample several kinds of sandwiches.
2. [Dave's Hot Chicken - Denver][dhcd] - Delicious and consistent. Can't go wrong with it. They have many levels of spice from mild to ridiculous.
3. [Dave's Hot Chicken - Westminster][dhcw] - A new location that's closer to where I live. Same great quality.
4. [Jerusalem Restaurant][jr] - Great food, even though the waiter said I look like his grandfather, the little brat.
5. [Blackjack Pizza Broomfield][bpb] - Has halal 'pepperoni' on their pizzas. I haven't eaten here, so call to make sure this is still the case before going there. 
6. [Blackjack Pizza Thornton][bpt] - Has halal 'pepperoni' on their pizzas. I haven't eaten here, so call to make sure this is still the case before going there.
7. [Ike's Sandwich][is] - Some (NOT ALL) of their sandwiches are Halal. Check before ordering. 
8. [Amir Grill][amir] - Good quality food. Nice people, who will give your their prayer rug if you come in during Salaat time.
9. [Amira Grill][amira] - Great Chicken Shawarma and Lebanese Burger. Their Lebanese burger is HUGE. 
10. [Halal Guys][hg] - I've only eaten here once. I thought the food was good.
11. [Silk Road][sg] - Haven't been there, but my friends say it's excellent.
12. [Babajoon's Kabob][bk] - Good sandwiches
13. [Durbar Nepalese And Indian Bistro](dni) - Good sit-down restaurant. 
14. [Bosphorus Turkish Restaurant][bt] - Haven't been there, but my friends say it's excellent.
15. [Azafaran][az] - They have a few halal offerings that are excellent - call to confirm before visiting. Be advised - they serve alcohol, so if you want to avoid places that serve alcohol, this is not the place for you.

My friends also say the pizza places in Estes Park (and any mountain town) are excellent; just ask for pizzas without meat.
