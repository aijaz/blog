After exactly two long months of development, and just in time for Ramadan, I'm pleased to announce the public release of my latest app, [QuranReflect](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quranreflect/id1444969758?mt=8)

<!-- more -->

This app allows you to read the Quran, write your own reflections on the verses that you're reading and view other people's reflections. People have already been using this service through the web for some time now, so you can already read thousands of reflections from authors you may know. People like Omar Suleiman, Dalia Mogahed, Maryam Amir, Yaser Birjas, and others. 

Allah ﷻ says in the Qur'an: 

أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ أَمْ عَلَىٰ قُلُوبٍ أَقْفَالُهَا

"Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'an, or are there locks upon [their] hearts? (47:24)" One of the things I like about this app is that it allows you to read what other people's reflections about an ayah, and then branch off to related topics, so you can get "lost" in your exploration of the Qur'an. 

Since I've been working on this app after hours, I haven't had time to blog all the cool things I learned in the process of making this app. I hope that changes in the next few days, now that the majority of the app dev work is done. 

I had been racing to get a usable version of the app ready before Ramadan. Unfortunately that means that I wasn't able to get accessibility and voiceover support as slick as I know it can be. I'm hoping to fix that in the next minor release. 

I hope you like the app.
