The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) has released their list of [Top 25 Most Dangerous Programming Errors](http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/). This list and the
explanations of the errors are very instructive and should help both novice
and expert programmers.Â  If you're a developer, I strongly urge you to read
this document and make sure you understand the concepts it covers.
