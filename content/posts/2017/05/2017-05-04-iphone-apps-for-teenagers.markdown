My brother-in-law asked me for recommendations for iPhone apps. His 16-year-old daughter just got her first iPhone, and he wants to know what I would recommend. Here is a quick list.

## Social Networking

Kids will get whatever it is their friends use. As of this writing, SnapChat is very popular with the high-school-aged crowd, but since I haven't used it, I can't recommend it. I fully expect that it would be one of the first apps a 16-year-old would install. Here are my recommendations for Social Networking: 

- [WhatsApp Messenger][whatsapp]: *It's secure, and a good way for families to have a private discussion group.*
- Stormcrow: *If you use Twitter a lot, this is a good way to create Tweetstorms (threads).*

## Personal Productivity

- 1Password: *Must-have password manager*
- Streaks: *This app changed my life. Motivate yourself to cultivate habits.*
- OmniFocus: *A pricey, but powerful task manager. Too much for all but the most organized kids.*
- White Noise: *Indespensible white noise generator for when people are talking and you wanna read or sleep.*
- Launch Center

## Business-ish
- Apple's iWork Suite: *Numbers, Pages, and Keynote.*
- Microsoft Office: *Word, Excel, and Powerpoint.*
- Dropbox
