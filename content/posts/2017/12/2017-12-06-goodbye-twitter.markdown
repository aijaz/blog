After more than nine years on Twitter, I finally deactivated my account. I refuse to contribute to the success of any platform that promotes the hatred of the villainous Donald Trump. I hope Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey never has to face the persecution that the vile Trump is trying to inflict on people like me. However, if anyone deserves it for enabling hatred, it is him.

You can find me here, and on [micro.blog][mb].

_**Update 1/8/2018:** After two weeks away from Twitter I came back when I learned that Twitter suspended the hateful account that was retweeted by Trump. There is a story about that [here][1]._

_It was this action that prompted me to re-enable my account._

_Those two weeks I wondered if I made the right decision. There are people I care about that I can only contact on Twitter. When I saw the news above, it was enough to change my mind. I would have been happier, of course, if they had removed Trump's account._
