It's time for our first Family Camping Trip. We will be camping at Mountain Park Campground, which is located on the Cache la Poudre River, 32 miles northwest of Fort Collins. Alhamdulillah, we have the group site reserved, so we will have plenty of space for campers and their vehicles, inshaAllah.

Mountain Park Campground is located on CO 14, on the Cache la Poudre River.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- _I have never camped before and have no idea what to do, and what to pack. Should I attend?_
    - Yes! We will let you know what to bring. We can recommend good, low-cost tents, pads, sleeping bags, etc. from places like WalMart, and if you want to buy top-of-the line equipment we can recommend that to you as well. MYPI staff will help you set up your tent (or anything else), if you need the help. But chances are, your other brothers and sisters attending will beat us to it. 
- _I am not interested in physical activities. I just want to sit by the river and eat good food. Should I attend?_
    - Yes! There are no required activities. If you want, you can chill all day, and relax as much as you want.
- _I am not interested in sitting by the river. I want an active event where I get 20,000 steps a day and get so tired that I fall asleep as soon as I enter my tent. Should I attend?_
    - Yes! There are a lot of opportunities for hikes. Some of them are very easy and chill. Others are very strenuous, and only recommended for people with some experience. 
- _I have a little child/sibling who I would have to bring with me. Should I attend?_
    - Yes! In the past people have brought toddlers with them. Of course, parents are responsible for their children. We will have activities for kids as well.
- _I don't want to miss my salaat. Should I attend?_
    - Yes! We will pray salaat in Jama'ah inshaAllah.
- _I don't like getting wet in the rain. Should I attend?_
    - Yes! InshaAllah we'll have canopies set up for outdoor eating and hanging out. We've also reserved a building/shelter where we can go if it rains a lot. Usually, if it rains it's just for a short time. 
- _I don't like camping if there aren't any S'mores. Should I attend?_
    - Yes! We'll have campfires and s'mores with Halal (Zabiha) marshmallows, inshaAllah.
