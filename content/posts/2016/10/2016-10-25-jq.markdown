Earlier tonight I spoke at NSCoder Chicago about how to use [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to examine JSON data. This post contains links and information that I would like to share with the attendees.

First of all, I created sample JSON data that contains information about characters from the [Avatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender) television series. The data is an array of objects, where each object looks like this: 

```json
  {
    "name": "Aang", 
    "sex": "M", 
    "born": -12,
    "died": 153,
    "bending": ["Air", "Water", "Earth", "Fire", "Energy"],
    "identity": {
      "nationality": "Southern Air Temple",
      "ethnicity": "Air Nomad"
    },
    "spouse": "Katara",
    "children": [
      { "sex": "M", "name":  "Bumi" }, 
      { "sex": "F", "name":  "Kya"}, 
      { "sex": "M", "name":  "Tenzin"}
    ]
  }
```

- A pretty-printed version of the sample JSON can be found [here](/static/jq/sampleClean.json).
