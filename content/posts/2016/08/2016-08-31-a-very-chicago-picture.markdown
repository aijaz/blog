How many Chicago cliches can you find here?

I see: 

- The CTA Bus with its classic 'cta' logo
- The "One North Dearborn" street address
- The [JCDecaux](http://www.jcdecauxna.com/street-furniture/chicago/advertising-chicago) bus stop
- The picture of the marquee of the [Chicago Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Theatre#/media/File:Chicago_Theatre_sign_Close_up.jpg) visible through one of the windows
- The picture hanging to its right. I recognize it, but can't recall where it's from
- And finally, the classic [Chicago windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_school_(architecture)) on the 1 N. Dearborn building. 

Oh, and if you look at the windows very carefully, you'll see the reflections of the [Oriel windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriel_window) of the building across the street ([Three First National Plaza](http://photos.wikimapia.org/p/00/02/24/49/68_full.jpeg)).
