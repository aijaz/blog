This is the first in a series of posts where I share the final screen of Letterpress games. When I was showing my daughter this game, she mentioned that she liked it when games ended in pleasing patterns. So then I started to try to win (or lose) games with a symmetric pattern, if possible. 

Most of the patterns are symmetric about an axis (reflection). Some display rotational symmetry. Where possible, I will also include a link to the replay URL of the game. Here's my first one.
