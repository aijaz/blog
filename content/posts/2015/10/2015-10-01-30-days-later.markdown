---

Well, that was fun. For the first time ever I wrote a blog post every day for a month. Here's what I learned:

<!-- more -->

* Sometimes I really didn't wanna do it. I was tired, or feeling lazy. But just like I said [about exercising][fitness], sometime you just have to show up. It's better than doing nothing.
* There were times when I had great ideas for posts but not enough time to research them and flesh the ideas out and write them concisely. Those will have to wait for another day. 
* There were things that I wanted to write about but they were so inconsequential that they seemed inappropriate for the [30 days][] posts. I wanted to write something at least a little bit interesting and not waste the reader's time. In a recent post [Daniel Steinberg quoted Ben Franklin][dsbf] as saying: "Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing." So I didn't want to fill my month with exercises. Those will also have to wait for another day.
* I wrote the same way almost every day: Write. Commit changes. Push to origin. Check for typos. Edit, commit, push, read. Edit, commit, push, read... and so on. I didn't realize it at first, but I was doing exactly what Daniel [suggested in his post][shh]: Don't be an editor on the first draft. Let the writer in you have a shot first. You can see this in my git commit log below. 
* The only reason I stuck to this schedule was because I was doing it with my friends [Daniel][], [Brad][], and, of course, [Jaimee][] who also motivated us to start in the first place. I am very grateful to them for their support and companionship this past month.

See you later!
