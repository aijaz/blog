This is one of my favorite things about the Workout App on the Apple Watch: the ability to start a workout without having any specific goal in mind. 


I love that I can just start and see where the workout takes me. There's no pressure reach a certain time or calorie count. I can just play it by ear.

See you tomorrow.
