I'd like to share with you the various tools that I've found work well for my [iOS class][class]. I'll show you what I use for video, displaying keyboard shortcuts, slides, and class notes.

## Video 

I have a couple of students who cannot attend in person, but attend via a live-streamed feed. I also want every class recorded so that I can provide a private video to the students. This allows them to refresh their memory or 
catch up on classes that they couldn't attend. So I need two cameras, one for the live stream, and one for the recorded video. I decided to use the camera on my MacBook for the live stream, because I don't like how the video appears, looking up at me. The angle is not very natural. 

I bought a [Logitech camera][webcam] for the recorded video. This camera is placed on a little tripod that is itself placed on the desk right behind my laptop. I can adjust the angle of this camera to just what I want. Even though I share my desktop during the class, in previous classes my students have said that they prefer to see a small video of me talking superimposed on the screen-cast. They find it a lot better than a disembodied voice. 

So, Macbook camera for live stream, and external camera for recorded video. For the live-stream I use [Zoom.us][zoom]. Of all the services I evaluated, I found that it had the best combination of features and price. Zoom also has an option to record the screen-cast, but it appears that I have no control over how and when the video file is produced. I like to process the raw video after I get home, so I can get back home as soon as possible. So I use [ScreenFlow][screenflow] for recording the screen-cast. I like being able to edit out the 10-minute breaks, and easily add transitions and callouts. ScreenFlow and Zoom work very well together. Because ScreenFlow's files can be rather large, I plug in an external drive while recording - I don't want to use my laptop's precious SSD drive for the video. 

## Keyboard Shortcuts

While I'm teaching I like to use Mousepos√©. This app allows me to display the various XCode keyboard shortcut combinations as I use them. So students get to learn the most efficient way to, say, show and hide the various navigators. 

## Slides

I don't often use slides, and when I do it's usually for complex topics like UIViewController lifecycles. I've found [Deckset][deckset] to be the ideal tool for displaying slides because of its support for code, and the fact that the source is in [Markdown][markdown] and therefore very easy to `grep`. 

## Class Notes

When I plan each day's class, I write my notes for that in class in Markdown and display the notes on my iPad. Because the notes are not on my laptop, my students never see me command-tabbing between XCode and my notes, in class or on the video. 

## Summary

I'm pretty happy with this setup. It's reliable and simple enough for me.  If you have any comments or suggestions, I'll be glad to hear them on [Twitter][twitter]. 

See you tomorrow.
