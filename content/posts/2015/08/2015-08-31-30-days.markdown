Inspired by [@jaimeejaimee][] and reminded by [@bradheintz][], I too will start a #30days writing experiment tomorrow. Let's give it a shot.

<!-- more -->

I am fortunate enough to have attended Jaimee's talk on burnout twice -  at [CocoaConf Yosemite][] and at [CocoaConf Chicago][]. In that talk she spoke about using lessons learned from Charles Duhigg's [The Power of Habit][] to form new habits. She introduced us to the concept of [30 days][]. 

When Brad mentioned #30days in a tweet recently I told myself, "Why not?" I'd like to give it a shot. Let's see if I can get myself to write more often.
