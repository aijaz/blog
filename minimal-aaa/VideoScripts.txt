# Loading

Hello. I'm gonna show you how to load a semi-automatic pistol. 

This is the Smith and Wesson M&P Shield 2.0

The first thing I'm gonna do is make sure the gun is safe. 

There's no magazine, and I can see that the chamber is empty.

In the next video I'll show you how to make sure the gun is safe.

I'll insert the first cartridge into the magazine by hand, and then I'll use the speedloader to insert the other 3 cartrdiges. 

I'll be inserting a total of 4 cartridges into the magazine.

After I insert the cartridges into the magazine, I insert the magazine into the gun

At this point the chamber is still empty. All the cartridges are in the magazine. 

If I were to pull the trigger nothing would happen. 

I load a cartridge into the chamber by pulling the slide back and letting it go. 

When I let go of the slide, it feeds the next cartridge from the magazine into the chamber. 

Now there's one cartridge in the chamber, and three in the magazine. 

Now the gun is in a state that I consider loaded. If I pull the trigger, a bullet comes out of the muzzle.

Let's have a look at that again.




# Unloading

Hello. I'm gonna show you how to safely unload a semi-automatic pistol. 

This gun is loaded. There are 3 cartridges in the magazine, and 1 in the chamber. 

The first thing to do is to eject the magazine using the magazine release button.

That removes three of the cartridges from the gun. 

Now we need to eject the cartridge that's in the chamber. 

We do that by pulling the slide back. This ejects the cartridge. 

Now we can confirm that there's no magazine in the gun,

And the chamber is empty. 

We can unload the magazine, and see that all four cartridges are accounted for. 



It is very important that we eject the magazine first, and then pull the slide. 

It has to be done in that order. 

If we pull the slide to eject the chambered cartridge first, then

Then, as soon as we release the slide, the next cartridge from the magazine is fed into the chamber.

I'll show you this. Keep in mind, that this is the WRONG THING TO DO. 



Again, I start with a gun loaded with four cartridges. 

Three in the magazine, and one in the chamber. 

I pull the slide. This releases the chambered cartridge, and it rolls off the table. That's cartridge #1. 

When I let go of the slide the next cartridge from the magazine (cartridge #2) is fed into the chamber. 

Now I eject the magazine. 

I unload the magazine. There are only two cartridges there. Cartridges 3 and 4. 

Remember, one was ejected from the chamber and fell off the table. 

Where's the fourth cartridge? It's still in the chamber. 

This gun is still loaded and just as lethal as ever, even though there's no magazine in it. 

If I were to pull the trigger now, a bullet would escape the muzzle. 

I pull the slide one more time to eject that cartridge (That's cartridge #2)

I pull the slide a few more times to confirm that nothing's in the chamber. 

I pick up cartidge #1 from the floor. 

Remember this is the wrong way to unload a gun. 

If you pull the slide before you drop the magazine, your gun is STILL loaded. 

Never unload a gun this way. 

Let's have another look at the right way of doing it:

Magazine first, then chamber. 

# Dry Fire

In this video I'll show you how to dry-fire to practice trigger pull and eliminate shot anticipation. 

There isn't much to it. First you have to make sure that your gun is safe. Make sure both the magazine and the chamber are empty. 

It is best to do this in a room in which there is no ammunition, just to be extra safe. 

Pull the slide back and release. 

Point the gun in a safe direction, and then slowly pull the trigger. 

Pull the slide back and release, to reengage the trigger. 

And repeat. 

Pay close attention to where your finger is on the trigger 

and if the gun jerks in any direction when you pull the trigger. 

Ideally, the gun should not move at all when you pull the trigger. 

Keep practicing, safely. 


# Cleaning

The first thing I do when I clean my gun is make sure it's safe. 

I do this in a room that doesn't have any ammo in it. 

Then I disassemble the gun. 

I don’t need to disassemble it completely. 

Just to the extent specified by the owner’s manual.

I use an old towel to help catch spills

I'll need cotton swabs, a think stick like a cuticle pusher, 

And a cleaning rod with a jag and bore brush

I'll need a bunch of patches as well. 

I put CLP solvent into the barrel and let it sit for a while

Then I use a wet patch to clean the recoil spring. 

It's really dirty, so I let that sit for a while, as well.

I then clean the slide with a wet patch, making sure to get the ejection port. 

I use my gloved fingernails to get into crevices. 

For really tight corners I use the pointy end of the cuticle pusher. 

This gun is really dirty after a day at the outdoor range

So it takes a while to get it reasonably clean. 

I use a wet patch to clean the inside of the frame

Especially the trigger mechanism. There's a lot of residue there. 

I use a cotton swab to get to the hard-to-reach places

I attach the bore brush to the cleaning rod 

I brush out the residue from inside the barrel. 

Add a little more solvent, and reapeat. 

I switch to the jag and take a wet patch and push it through the barrel

You can see how dirty it was in there.

I do this several times, alternating with a dry and wet patch, 

Until the dry patch comes out reasonably clean. 

I start wiping the gun with a dry patch

And brush off some residue from the spring. 

No it's time to start lubricating the gun. 

I apply CLP solution on a patch and leave a thin layer 

On the five areas that the owners manual says should be lubricated.  

And that's pretty much it. I reassemble the gun. 

Dry my gloved fingers with a patch. 

I put the slide back on

Flip up the takedown lever

And we're done. 

I give it a quick wipe or two with a microfiber cloth, and it's ready to go>!
