As a hacker by nature, I enjoy making things.  I'm the developer and 
designer behind the [Qur'an Memorizer](http://quranmemorizer.com)
iOS app, and am currently working as an iOS developer at
[FastModel](http://www.fastmodelsports.com).  I [teach iOS development on the weekends](http://euclidte.ch/) to children and adults in the community. I like to dabble in photography, woodworking, origami, and making tangible things with my hands. Oh, I've also
written  a pretty nifty open-source job scheduler called
[TaskForest](http://www.taskforest.com). For those who're interested, I've also put up 
a <a href="http://aijaz.net/about/index.html#work">somewhat detailed account of my work experience</a>.

I'm a student of Wing Chun Kung Fu, having studied at the excellent
[Philip Nearing School of Wing Chun](http://wingchunchicago.com/).  I've
also [made a Kung Fu wooden dummy](http://aijaz.net/2012/07/15/making-a-kung-fu-wooden-dummy/) (what a fun project!).

Finally, I'm also a fitness enthusiast, with a particular fondness for Tony Horton's P90X series.
