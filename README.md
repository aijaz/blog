As a hacker by nature, I enjoy making things.  I'm the developer and 
designer behind the <a href="http://quranmemorizer.com">Qur'an Memorizer</a>
iOS app, and am currently working as an iOS developer at
<a href="http://www.fastmodelsports.com">FastModel Sports</a>.  I <a href="http://euclidte.ch">teach iOS development on the weekends</a> to children and adults in the community. I like to dabble in photography, woodworking, origami, and making tangible things with my hands. Oh, I've also
written  a pretty nifty open-source job scheduler called
<a href="http://www.taskforest.com">TaskForest</a>. For those who're interested, I've also put up 
a <a href="http://aijaz.net/about/index.html#work">somewhat detailed account of my work experience</a>.

I'm a student of Wing Chun Kung Fu, having studied at the excellent
<a href="http://wingchunchicago.com">Philip Nearing School of Wing Chun</a>.  I've
also <a href="http://aijaz.net/2012/07/15/making-a-kung-fu-wooden-dummy/">made a Kung Fu wooden dummy</a> (what a fun project!).

Finally, I'm also a fitness enthusiast, with a particular fondness for Tony Horton's P90X series.
